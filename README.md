# LaTeX Pleroma Mod

this mod adds LaTeX to pleroma. It should be more or less compatible with Misskey

## Installation

just clone this repository into your pleroma-mods folder

## Configuration

None as of yet

## Usage

Embed your LaTeX Expression between \( and \) and it will get rendered through KaTeX (this also triggers Misskey to render it)
